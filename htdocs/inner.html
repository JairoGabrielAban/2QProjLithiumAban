						<span class="bold">Pollution -</span>
						Pollution of air, water, and soil caused by toxins such as plastics, heavy metals and nitrates. These residues are caused by human activities such as oil spills, 
						industrial waste, and combustion of fossil fuels.

                    <p>
						<span class="bold">Global Warming -</span> 
						The emission of greenhouse gases due to human activities cause global warming. Global warming causes an increase in the temperaturec that leads to 
						rising sea levels, melting of polar ice caps, flash floods, and desertification.

                    <p>
						<span class="bold">Overpopulation -</span> 
						Overpopulation can lead to shortages of resources such as food, water, and fuel. Most developing countries practice intensive agriculture to lessen the problem, 
						but it actually leads to more damage through the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and insecticides.

                    <p>
						<span class="bold">Deforestation -</span>
						Loss of trees in order to make space for residential, industrial, or commercial projects lessens the oxygen produced. Less oxygen tends to affects the
						temperature, and the amount of rainfall in a negative manner.

                <span class="paragraph">
                    <p>
						<span class="bold">Ozone Layer Depletion -</span>
					     Pollution caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the air creates a hole in the ozone layer. This layer protects Earth from harmful UV radiation, 
						 so the hole in the ozone layer can lead to enormous negative impacts in our environment.
