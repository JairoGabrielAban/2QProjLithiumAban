						Organic material was the largest component of the garbage generated, the EPA said. Commercial or industrial waste is a significant portion of 
						solid waste. According to the University of Utah, industries use 4 million pounds of materials in order to provide the average American family 
						with needed products for one year. Households generate hazardous waste as well, including paints and solvents, motor oil, fluorescent lights, 
						aerosol cans and ammunition.

						<span class="bold">Water Pollution -</span> 
							Water pollution happens when chemicals or dangerous foreign substances are introduced to water, including chemicals, sewage, pesticides 
							and fertilizers from agricultural runoff, or metals like lead or mercury. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 44% of 
							assessed stream miles, 64% of lakes and 30% of bay and estuarine areas are not clean enough for fishing and swimming.  Due to water pollution,
							783 million people do not have access to clean water and around 2.5 billion do not have access to adequate sanitation.

						<span class="bold">Air Pollution -</span> 
						OThe air we breathe has a very exact chemical composition; 99% of it is made up of nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor and inert gases. Air pollution occurs 
						when things that aren't normally there are added to the air. A common type of air pollution happens when people release particles into the air 
						from burning fuels. This pollution looks like soot, containing millions of tiny particles, floating in the air.
