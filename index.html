						<p>
							In today's modern world, we, humans, deal with a lot of challenges, conflicts, and difficulties. These problems can be about politics, religion, science
							and technology, or just the simple ones that we need to face every single day, but the world has a huge problem that only a little amount 
							of people actually care. This is the global environmental problems such as global warming, climate change, deforestation, and a lot more. 	
						</p>	
						
						<p>	
							The purpose of this website is to raise awareness that these problems exist, and needs more attention and care, because these problems will be the most 
							impactful and problematic in the near future, and if we did not urge the solutions for these problems, it can cause serious damages not only to humans, 
							but also to Earth and the biosphere itself.
						</p>
                    
						<p>
							These negative effects can even lead to mass extinctions of species including us, humans. Earth's resources will also be affected and there will be
							no reserved food, water, and fuel for the next generations if we continue to pollute and destroy our environment.
